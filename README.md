**SystemUI Notifier**
===========

This module allows you to move certain notification icons into the right side of the SystemUI's statusbar, where the system icons are normally located. The corresponding notifications can be also optionally removed from the notification panel.

Why? Because I wanted to have the battery in circle again and I was annoyed with custom ROMs seemingly dropping this altogether.

**Discussion/Support:** [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/mod-xposed-app-settings-reborn.4141339)

**Compatibility:**
The application was tested only on Android 11 AOSP, Android 11, 12 OneUI.

This module is provided as is without any promise of support. But I do welcome pull requests.

The tasker profile accomplishing the battery circle is within the repo: [TaskerProfile.prj.xml](/TaskerProfile.prj.xml)
