SystemUI Notifier
===========

**Discussion/Support:** [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/mod-xposed-app-settings-reborn.4141339)

**Compatibility:**
The application was tested only on Android 11 AOSP, Android 11, 12 OneUI.

This module is provided as is without any promise of support. But I do welcome pull requests.

**Information:**
This module allows for moving certain notification icons into the right side of the SystemUI's statusbar. The corresponding notifications can be also optionally removed.
Why? Because I wanted to have the battery in circle again and I was annoyed with custom ROMs seemingly droping this altogether.

The tasker profile accomplishing the battery circle is within the repo: [TaskerProfile.prj.xml](/TaskerProfile.prj.xml)
